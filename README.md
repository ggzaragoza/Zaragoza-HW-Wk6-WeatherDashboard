# Zaragoza-HW-Wk6-WeatherDashboard

In this repository, you will find files for CodeFront, the hottest and coolest new weather application out there! The application provides simple forecasts for the current date and the following five days. The user is instructed to search for forecasts via entering a city name, as this parameter will match city names within the data provided by the OpenWeather API. A search history is generated once a forecast is displayed, and these buttons also allow users to view previous searched cities during their visit to the application.

As the application now runs, local storage is able to record visitors' inputs, remaining logged after leaving and returning to the page. However, this record is erased once the user enters their first new city upon revisiting the page. Furthermore, the buttons generated to the search history element within the HTML structure do not remain appended to the page upon subsequent visits, and it is possible to record duplicate buttons during a visit after entering the same city more than once.

With a clean and minimal user interface, CodeFront is able to display weather data easily and beautifully, and hopefully the storage issues can be revisited in the future.
